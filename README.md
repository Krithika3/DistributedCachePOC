 A simple distributed cache POC using Spring boot

## Local Setup:
 1. Run DistributedCachePOC/src/main/java/com/distributed/cache/poc/test/CachePocController.java to test using cache with a Spring Boot REST service.
 2. To connect to the database please provide the credentials in application.properties.
 3. Run DistributedCachePOC/src/main/java/com/distributed/cache/poc/test/TestCachePoc.java to test distributed caching services using multiple threads.(WIP). It has a main method.
 

## What does this app do?
This app is used to test a poc for a distributed caching service.
